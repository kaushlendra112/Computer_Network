# Computer_Network
This repo contains experiments Basic networking command, socket programming, routing &amp; subnetting using Cisco packet tracer.

🔹 1. Basic Networking Commands

Experiments include commonly used diagnostic and network-analysis commands:

ipconfig,
ipconfig/all,
ping,
tracert,
arp -a,
nslookup,
netstat

🔹 2. Socket Programming (C / Python)

Implemented socket programs demonstrating real client-server communication:

TCP Programs,
TCP Client–Server Program,
Multi-Client Chat Server,
File Transfer (TCP)

Includes:
Source code (.C)
Explanations of functions (socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), end(), etc.)
Input/output samples

🔹 3. Routing & Subnetting (Cisco Packet Tracer)

Lab exercises include:
Basic topology creation
IP Addressing
Subnetting
Static & dynamic routing
Packet flow analysis
Packet Tracer files (.pkt) are included for each experiment.
